### Context:
This project for Turing Mod 1 Front End students took me about 15 hours. Much of that time was spent getting the hang of CSS.

### Learning Goals:
The goal was to learn how to build a website to comp with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I learned how to use local storage for this project, giving users the ability to keep their favorites.


### Wins + Challenges:
The CSS component on this project was by far the most challenging for me. I found that it was often unpredicatble for me and required a lot of tinkering to get right. Each time I finally got an element to the size and place I wanted it I was absolutely delighted. 

A big win for me was getting local storage to work. It ended up being far easier than I was expecting. I am so excited to apply it in future projects.
